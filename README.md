# Easycontroller (beta)
Application for using midi-controllers in an easy and convinient way across Unity, max/msp and Openframeworks (Only for Mac users). The idea is to be able to master your midi-controller in live music and visual, independently of the platform used. Initially,  map your midi-controller by touching the knobs and click on the desired knob in th panel. Then you set to work with the  paramters directly in your OF app and Max patch. You can label knobs/pads for each parameter in your program/song/visualization,  assign various value-ranges for each slider, and set presets for your midi-controller in each chapter of your performance. We perform with this tool at 42Noir, we've tested it mostely for Novation and Yamaha controllers, but if your controller has unique midi formating (:/) contact us and we would try to sort it out for you.
